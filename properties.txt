Properties
I.memory writes
   a. when writing to arrays in memory (program, boot, d, data2, data1,
   exp_reg_*), index should not exceed bounds (array out of bounds)
   b. RSA keys should only change during the key hash check/load step
II. locking
   a. input data to modules is locked while modules are running
   b. during the whole secureboot process, the RSA message register and write
   location is locked to outside processes
   c. in between when the header is checked and the program is loaded, the whole
   image is locked
III. program flow
   a. module that starts will finish
   b. either verification fails, or verification passes each stage and program
   is loaded, no skipping steps
IV. hyperproperties
   a. if # modules is the same, SP is always the same
   b. if a memory address is locked, then nothing that the processor/attacker
   does will change the memory contents
