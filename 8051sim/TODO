- First we have to get rid of the ugly hack that is Node.name_index.
- Have to make sure names are unique. Should we write some code for this?
  Perhaps an AST pass that walks through fragments of the tree to make sure
  everything is good?
- We have to write a pass that walks through the AST and replaces each variable
  with its corresponding value from the distinguishing input model. ReadMem
  here will have to handle arrays appropriately. This will replace _addClauses
  in the synthesizer.
