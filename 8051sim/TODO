The next(PC) computation is complete. Computing the next(ACC) is trickier/messier that I expected. I am
considering whether we should compute all state updates at the same time, using a single large formula.

Suppose we write:

SRC1 = Choice(...)
SRC2 = Choice(...)
RES_RR = ...
RES_INC = ...

What we want is destination choice:
  WriteChoice('inc_result', op0, RES_INC,
    [ACC, 'IRAM
